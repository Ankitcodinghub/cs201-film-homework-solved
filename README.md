In this homework, you will implement a film collection system to store the lead actor names of films in a particular collection. For each film, you will store its title, its director, its year, its duration and its list of lead actors. In your implementation, the collection of films and the list of lead actors in each film will need to be implemented using dynamically allocated arrays. The homework has two parts whose requirements are explained below.

PART A:

To take the final exam, you must submit this part and receive at least half of its points.

This part is a simplified version of the entire system. It stores the titles, directors, years and durations of films in a collection without their list of lead actors. The films will be stored in a dynamically allocated array of Film objects. Thus, you will first implement the Film class. This class is rather simple for Part A, but will need to be extended for Part B.

Additionally, you should implement your own copy constructor and destructor, and overload the assignment operator and the &lt;&lt; operator for outputting Film objects. Although you may use the default ones for some of these member functions, you are advised to implement them (although some may have no statements) in Part A so that it will be easier for you to extend them in Part B.</li>

<li>Implement the default constructor, which creates an empty film collection. Also implement the copy constructor and destructor, and overload the assignment operator.</li>

Add a film: This function adds a film to the collection. The title, the director, the year, and the duration are specified as parameters. In this collection, the pair of title and director are unique (however, there can be multiple films with the same title and multiple films of the same director). Thus, if the user attempts to add a film with an already existing title and director, do not add the film and return false. Do not display any warning messages. Otherwise, if the film does not exist in the collection, add it to the collection and return true.

Remove a film: This function removes a film from the collection. The title and the director are specified as parameters. If the given film exists in the collection, remove it from the collection

<ul>
<li>Implement the get function for films. The getFilms function should return the number of the films in the collection using the return value and the films in the collection by a pass-by- reference parameter called allFilms. Do not forget to put a deep copy of the films to the pass-by-reference parameter; otherwise, you may encounter run-time errors.</li>

However, do not submit any file containing the main function; otherwise, you may lose a considerable number of points. We will code our own driver to grade Part A of your assignment. In doing that, we will use the get functions of the Film and FC classes. Thus, do not forget to implement the get functions of these two classes. Below is an example of the test code and its output. In this example code, there is a global function called displayAllFilms. We will use it to display the films in the collection and to understand whether you add/remove films correctly. If you want, you may use this global function for your tests as well. Notice that the last line of this global function is to deallocate the allFilms array. Do not remove this line if you get any run-time errors while using the function. If you have such run-time errors, most probably, you

You should put your SimpleFilm.h, SimpleFilm.cpp, SimpleFC.h, and SimpleFC.cpp files into a folder and zip the folder. In this zip file, there should not be any file containing the main function. The name of this zip file needs to be:

PartA_secX_Firstname_Lastname_StudentID.zip

where X is your section number. Then you should follow the steps that are explained at the end of this document for the submission of Part A.

What to be careful about implementation and submission for Part A?

PART B:

Now, Part A is to be extended such that each film has a list of lead actors. The full functionality of this extended FC system is to be provided. In order for this to be done, the Film class needs to be extended such that it additionally keeps the list of lead actors contained. The lead actor list of a film must be kept in a dynamically allocated array of Actor objects. Note that the number of lead actors can be different from one film to another, but is normally fixed for a particular film. The details of the classes are given below.

<li>Implement the following functions that your extended system should support.
Add a film: This function adds a film to the collection. The title, the director, the year, and the duration are specified as parameters. In this function, the lead actor list is not specified; if there are any, lead actor(s) will be added later. In the film collection, the pair of title and director are unique (however, there can be multiple films with the same title and multiple films of the same director).

Remove a film: This function removes a film from the collection. The title and the director are specified as parameters. If the given film exists in the collection, remove it from the collection and return true. Otherwise, if there is no film with the given title and director, do not perform any action and return false. Likewise, do not display any warning messages.

<div class="page" title="Page 8">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
you will have implemented in Part A. But now, for Part B, you should also remove the lead actor list when you remove the film from the collection.

Add a lead actor to the film: This function adds an actor to the lead actor list of a film in the collection. The title and the director of the film together with the name, the birth place, and the birth year of the actor are specified as parameters. In this function, you should take care of the following issues:

o If the specified film does not exist in the collection, do not perform any action and return false. Do not display any warning messages.

o All actor names are unique in a film. Thus, if the user attempts to add an actor with an existing name for the specified film, do not perform any action and return false. Do not display any warning messages. (However, different films may have an actor with the same name.)

o Otherwise, add the actor to the lead actor list of the specified film and return true.

Remove lead actor list from the film: This function clears the lead actor list of a film. The title and the director are given as parameters. If there is no film with the specified title and director, or if there are no actors in the lead actor list, do not perform any action and return false. Do not display any warning messages. Otherwise, clear the lead actor list of the specified film and return true.

Calculate the average duration of films in the collection: This function calculates the average duration of all films in the collection and returns the result. If there are no films in the collection, this function should return 0.

Below is an example of the test code and its output. In this example code, there are two global functions called displayAllFilms and displayStatistics. The former is the same as the one implemented for Part A. The purpose of the latter is to obtain some statistics about films. We will use these functions to understand whether you add/remove films and actor lists correctly. If you want, you may use these global functions for your tests as well. Again the last line is included to deallocate the allFilms array. Do not remove this line if you get any run-time errors while using these functions. If you have such run-time errors, most probably, you made an error in implementing either the getFilms function or one or more of the destructor, copy constructor, and overloaded assignment operator.

You must use dynamically allocated arrays. You will receive no points if you use automatically allocated arrays, linked-lists or any other data structures such as vector/array from the standard library.

You are not allowed to use any global variables or any global functions when implementing the classes. However, you may use global functions to test your program, but should not submit them.

Your code must not have any memory leaks. You will lose points if your code has memory leaks even though it produces correct output. To detect memory leaks, you may want to use Valgrind which is available at http://valgrind.org.
